# Automating-Tree-Counting-through-UAVs-and-YOLOv5-Object-Detection
This repository presents an innovative approach to automate tree counting using YOLOv5, a state-of-the-art object detection model, coupled with high-resolution UAV imagery. By leveraging the power of deep learning, our algorithm intelligently detects and counts individual trees even in densely packed areas with overlapping crowns.
